How to play Ship Fight 


The game starts when the PLAY GAME button is clicked.
At the top of the screen that opens, there are 10 ships that can be placed. 
When you click on these ships, the color of the appropriate places on the map appears as green. 
When you give up placing the ship or you realize that the ship is not suitable for the place you are trying to place, you can cancel this operation by clicking on the ship again. 
After placing the ship, click on the Ship Ready button.


Shooting Types
You have 2 methods to shoot with ships in Ship Fight game. 
The first is the Passive Attribute. 
This shot has 1 shot right (if the ship does not have a skill in this regard). 
In this type of shot, if you hit the enemy ship, you get 1 more shot (if the opponent's ship does not have the ability to disrupt this situation). 
You can shoot up to 3 shots in this shot type. 
After 3 accurate shots, it's your opponent's turn.

The second shot type is Active Attribute. 
This shot varies according to the active skill of the ship. 
For example, the Faker ship has 1 shot right, but if it hits the opponent's ship, it will detonate that ship completely. 
For example, BombCatcher's active ability is 5 shots. 
After 5 shots, the turn passes to the opponent.
Even if there are enough points after using active features, they cannot be used for 2 rounds.
